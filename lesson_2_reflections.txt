The staging area is different for my working directory and repository because it is a folder that stores files teporaryly giving the oportunity of modify the content of those files anytime without modifying the final commits. 

The staging area can be used to do one commit per logical change, I don't know how yet, but I suppose someone at Udacity will tell me soon.
